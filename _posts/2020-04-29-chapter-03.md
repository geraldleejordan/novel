Janice woke with a headache. The sun was up and a bird could be heard far away. She had fallen asleep as the sun was coming up. Sliding her feet off the bed, she managed to sit up.

Coffee.

Slowly she pushed back the blanket, lunged for the door and made her way to the small room that served as a kitchen. "What had this place been before the troubles began," she wondered? Her focus turned to her throbbing head and she quickly ran to the toilets, making it just in time to raise the lid and vomit on the seat. Shaking, she huddled over the toilet for some minutes.

Tears began to run down her face again. "WHY?" She thought of him for a moment and then returned to heaving with nothing left to expel. 

Finally her body stopped. The tears ended. The baby kicked. She wanted to laugh and to cry. Grabbing an old rag, she began to clean the toilet, then herself, then headed to the kitchen.

Coffee, please.

She must have looked quite the sight when she entered the kitchen, as the older man inside flinched when she entered.

"Morning, uh, almost afternoon!"

"Morning," she said.

"I am Pete."

"Janice. Coffee somewhere?"

"Over there," he pointed to a glass kettle stained so black it was hard to see if there was actually coffee in it.

She reached across the room for it, hoping it would somehow come to her. Looking, she found an old cup in the cupboard, on which was barely legible, "Don't let the bastards drag you down!" She laughed, despite herself, and poured a cup of the black liquid into the cup that had seen so many like her. Taking a seat at the table, she wrapped her hands around the cup and began to slowly drink, as if meditating.

"Why is someone in your state travelling alone, if I might ask?"

His words broke into her few moments of bliss.

"I am single," she said, not wanting to say more.

"Oh, sorry. I didn't mean to pry." 

She knew he did, but tried to return to her coffee.

"I heard you come in yesterday evening. You slept awhile!"

Not really, she thought, but said, "Yeah."

"I have been here awhile. Lost my job when it all started."

[pause]

"Can you guess what I was?"

I don't care, she thought. "No."

"You certainly aren't much of a talker! I was a preacher! Saved souls!"

One of those nuts, she thought.
