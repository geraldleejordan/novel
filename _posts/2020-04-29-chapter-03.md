Janice woke with a headache. The sun was up and a bird could be heard far away. She had fallen asleep as the sun was coming up. Sliding her feet off the bed, she managed to sit up.

Coffee.

Slowly she pushed back the blanket, lunged for the door and made her way to the small room that served as a kitchen. "What had this place been before the troubles began," she wondered? Her focus turned to her throbbing head and she quickly ran to the toilets, making it just in time to raise the lid and vomit on the seat. Shaking, she huddled over the toilet for some minutes.

Tears began to run down her face again. "WHY?" She thought of him for a moment and then returned to heaving with nothing left to expel. 

Finally her body stopped. The tears ended. The baby kicked. She wanted to laugh and to cry. Grabbing an old rag, she began to clean the toilet, then herself, then headed to the kitchen.

Coffee, please.

She must have looked quite the sight when she entered the kitchen, as the older man inside flinched when she entered.

"Morning, uh, almost afternoon!"

"Morning," she said.
